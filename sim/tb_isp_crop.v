// A line wider than the pack was built for is CROPPED, not reinterpreted.
//
// The receiver upstream refuses only what its own buffers cannot hold --
// 3276 samples at 10-bit -- while the pack's line buffers are built for
// 1920. Everything between those two numbers arrives perfectly well
// formed and is the pack's to survive. It cannot: its pointwise cores
// get neither the stream's end-of-line nor the header's width, so they
// reframe every line from start-of-frame plus their built width, declare
// a new row part-way through the sensor's, and invert the CFA phase on
// alternate rows. The picture shears and the colours swap, with no
// status bit anywhere.
//
// So the shim crops. What is checked here is that cropping is not itself
// a new way to lose things:
//
//   NARROWER IS STILL WHOLE   a line at or under the built width passes
//                             through untouched -- the ordinary case
//                             must cost nothing.
//   THE SURPLUS IS DRAINED    dropped samples are ACCEPTED, never
//                             stalled. A stalled surplus never reaches
//                             its line end and the frame stops.
//   THE PACK SEES ITS WIDTH   exactly WIDTH valid samples per line,
//                             so its own counter wraps where the line
//                             really ends and the phase stays intact.
//   THE FRAME END SURVIVES    the pack COMMITS COEFFICIENTS on the
//                             incoming end-of-frame. On a cropped line
//                             that sample is one the pack never sees, so
//                             the flag is re-timed onto the last kept
//                             sample. Gated away instead, every
//                             calibration write would sit in the shadow
//                             forever -- on exactly the frames where
//                             something is already wrong.
//   AND IT SAYS SO            `truncated` is sticky, because a narrower
//                             picture must not read as a zoomed sensor.
