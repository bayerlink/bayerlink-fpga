"""Emit the pixel datapath's cells and wires, from the design description.

The datapath used to be drawn by hand in Tcl, and hand-drawn wiring is
where every width bug in this repo has lived -- because a block design
answers a mismatch with a CRITICAL WARNING and a silent connection of
the low bits, so the symptom is a picture rather than an error.

So the datapath is DESCRIBED (design.json) and the Tcl is generated,
with the widths checked on the way through. An edge whose two ends
disagree stops the build here, named, before Vivado starts.

What this owns: our own blocks that carry the stream, the parameters
they are built at, and the stream edges between them.

What it deliberately does NOT own: clocks, resets, vendor IP and the
AXI automation. Those stay hand-written in bd.tcl -- a declarative
model of Vivado's interconnect automation would be a worse version of
something that already works, and the clock/reset discipline is audited
after the build by checkhwh.py, which reads what was actually produced.

    python3 gen/netlist.py --board pynq-z2

Writes boards/<board>/generated/netlist.tcl, which bd.tcl sources.
