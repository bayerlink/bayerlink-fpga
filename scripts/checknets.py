"""Check every wire the block design draws between OUR OWN blocks.

np2hw checks this inside a composed core -- "a composer that does not
check this connects a 10-bit Bayer stream to a block built for 12-bit
RGB and emits Verilog that elaborates, which is the worst kind of
wrong". That check stops at the core's boundary. Everything outside it
is `connect_bd_net`, and a block design answers a width mismatch with a
CRITICAL WARNING and a silent connection of the low bits.

Every bug of that shape this repo has had lived in exactly that gap:

  the ISP's input port was written [9:0] and stayed right until the
  pipeline moved to 12 bits, at which point the receiver's top two bits
  were dropped and the picture was merely darker;

  the glue that packs RGB for the framebuffer was written [29:0] and
  would have read three wrong fields the moment the ISP traced 36;

  the identity word came to 35 bits into a 32-bit GPIO and had been
  saying so, in a warning nobody read, for weeks.

So the widths are compared before Vivado starts, from the two things
that actually know them: the module's own Verilog, with the parameters
the block design passes it, and the design's own connections.

    python3 scripts/checknets.py [boards/pynq-z2/bd.tcl]

Vendor IP is out of scope -- its ports are not in files here, and its
automation is doing real work. This is about the wires we draw.
