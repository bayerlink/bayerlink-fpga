"""Structural checks on the block-design script, before a build spends 20 minutes.

`bd.tcl` is hand-written Tcl with build-time flags, and Tcl finds its
mistakes by running into them -- twenty minutes in, having already
synthesised everything up to that line. Every check here was added after
it cost exactly that.

  BRACES BALANCE          an unclosed guard silently swallows the rest
                          of the file into a branch that may not run.
  CREATED BEFORE USED     a cell referenced above its own
                          `create_bd_cell` is a typo Tcl reports as a
                          missing object, with no hint that the object
                          appears later.
  USED INSIDE ITS GUARD   the one this file exists for. A cell created
                          inside `if {$capture}` and wired outside it
                          builds perfectly with the flag on and cannot
                          build at all with it off -- so a configuration
                          the README offers stays broken until someone
                          tries it. Three of these were sitting in this
                          repo on 2026-08-18, and the first two greps
                          missed the third because it names its cell as
                          an address space rather than as a pin.

That last point is why the pattern below lists every syntax bd.tcl uses
to NAME a cell. A check that knows one spelling finds one bug.
