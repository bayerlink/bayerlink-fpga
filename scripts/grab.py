"""Grab frames to a file, then leave the fabric exactly as found.

The grabber is an instrument, not a path the picture depends on:
the display is direct and genlocked, and stays whole whether this
script runs, tears, or is never invoked. Each frame is captured
cleanly by construction -- arm, wait for the engine's own
completion, halt inside the following blanking, then copy -- so no
software race with the writer is possible.

Bounded by shape: N frames, then the engine is halted, the grab
branch disabled, the buffer freed, and the process exits. A write
engine must never outlive the memory it writes.
