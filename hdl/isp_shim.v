// the AXI4-Lite port carried to the boundary, nothing else. The pack
// itself (hdl/generated/revela_isp_core.v) is generated and verified by
// revela from gen/pipeline.json; this file is hand-shaped board glue,

// geometry, the core's name -- restate that design's facts, so the two
// files change together or not at all.
//
// Parameters are LIVE: written over the register map, landing in a
// shadow, committed at the frame boundary, so a frame is processed with
// one coherent set or none of it. NEUTRAL at power-on -- calibration is
// a sensor fact, restored over the cable by whoever holds the sensor's

    // correct exactly until the pipeline moved to 12 bits, at which
    // point a block design connects the low ten and calls it a warning.

    // beat, so its input width IS the sample width that rx_axis and
    // axis_unpack are built at; it was briefly carried alongside them
    // under a name of its own, which made two numbers out of one and
    // then wanted a check to keep them equal.
