// The ISP's RGB stream, dressed as AXI4-Stream video for a VDMA S2MM
// writing the framebuffer. Channel 0 rides the LOW bits of the pipeline
// word (revela's packing law); the framebuffer byte order comes from
// rgb2dvi's bus: [23:16] R, [15:8] B, [7:0] G -- via the little-endian
// framebuffer word, bytes G, B, R, pad. tuser marks start of frame,
// tlast end of line: the VDMA's dialect.
//
// DATA_BITS is the width the ISP actually TRACED, passed in by the block
// design from what the generator published. It was written down here as
// 30 while the pipeline was 10-bit, and that is a number which stays
// correct until the day the pipeline changes and then produces a picture
// rather than an error -- the slices would still elaborate against a
// wider word and quietly read the wrong bits.

    // A FENCE, not a wire -- because this module's reset and its
    // consumer's are different laws. The ISP island resets when the
    // LINK drops; the VDMA on the far side keeps its clock and its
    // reset and remembers every promise made to it. The combinational
    // version passed tvalid straight through, so the island reset
    // CHOPPED a transfer mid-beat -- an AXI-Stream protocol violation
    // -- and a DataMover holding a violated handshake wedges, taking
    // its register interface with it and, since AXI has no timeout,
    // the first software access after that, and the processor. Pulled
    // cable, frozen TV, dead board: measured on 2026-08-18.

    // already offered stays offered, stable, until the sink takes it.

    // starve -- at worst the restartable frame-count halt, never a
    // violation. Power-on state comes from the initial values (GSR),
    // which is exactly the one moment nothing can be in flight.
